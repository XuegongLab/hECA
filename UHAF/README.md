# Introduction

We designed the structured vocabulary in macroscope level and the microscope level. The macroscope level annotations describe the anatomical information including the relationship between the human body, system, organ, the region and the subregion. The microscope level annotations describe the histological type (the “tissue_type”) and the cellular identities (the “cell_type”) that arise from the molecular heterogeneities of the cells. The macroscope annotation terms form composition ("part_of") relationships while the terms in the microscope level possess inheritance relationship ("is_a"). 


### Macroscope ontology

The macroscope level mainly containing anatomical information including system, organ, region, subregion.
- Human body
  - System
    - Organ
      - Suborgan 
> For example:
- Human body
  - Cardiovascular system
    - Heart
      - Atrium
        - Left atrium
        - Right atrium

### Microscope ontology

The microscope level annotations describe the histological type (the “tissue_type”) and the cellular identities (the “cell_type”) that arise from the molecular heterogeneities of the cells.
- Cell
  - Tissue_type
    - Cell_type
> For example:
- Cell
  - Connective tissue
    - Hematocyte
      - Leukocyte
        - Lymphocyte
           - T cell
             - CD4 T cell
             - CD8 T cell
